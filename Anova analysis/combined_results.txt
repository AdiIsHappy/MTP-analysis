**Average Duration in Table Cover**

The results of the between-subjects ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Task on average duration in table cover (F(1, 76) = 4.15, p = 0.045, ηp² = 0.052). Participants in the No Task condition (M = 9.62, SE = 2.00) spent significantly longer in table cover compared to those in the Book Task condition (M = 3.87, SE = 2.00). The main effect of Information was not statistically significant (F(1, 76) = 1.47, p = 0.229, ηp² = 0.019). There was no significant interaction between Information and Task (F(1, 76) = 0.13, p = 0.724, ηp² = 0.002).

**Average Seated Duration**

The Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances was significant (F(3, 76) = 3.258, p = 0.026), indicating that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated. However, given the equal sample sizes across groups, we proceed with the interpretation of the ANOVA results.

The result revealed a significant main effect of Information (F(1, 76) = 7.657, p = 0.007, ηp² = 0.092) with average seated duration significantly higher when information was given (M = 6.56, SE = 0.79) than when it was not given (M = 3.49, SE = 0.79).

There was also a significant main effect of Task (F(1, 76) = 20.509, p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.213) with participants in the No Task condition (M = 7.54, SE = 0.79) showing a significantly higher average seated duration than those in the Book Task condition (M = 2.51, SE = 0.79).

There was no significant interaction between information and task (F(1, 76) = 0.030, p = 0.863, ηp² = 0.000).

ANALYSIS FOR: books_placed_across_time.pdf
==================================================

Here is the interpretation of the ANOVA results for "Books Placed":

Upon analysis, Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for the main effect of Time (χ²(2) = 16.975, p < 0.001), and consequently for interactions involving Time. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = 0.835) for the within-subjects effects.

There was a significant main effect of Time on the number of books placed (F(1.67, 130.23) = 13.30, p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.146). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction revealed that significantly fewer books were placed during the earthquake (M = 0.98, SE = 0.17) compared to before (M = 1.50, SE = 0.23; p = 0.006) and after (M = 2.11, SE = 0.30; p < 0.001). Significantly more books were placed after the earthquake compared to before the earthquake (p = 0.045). The type of Information given had no significant main effect on the number of books placed (F(1, 78) = 0.15, p = 0.697, ηp² = 0.002). There was no significant interaction between Time and Information (F(1.67, 130.23) = 2.72, p = 0.079, ηp² = 0.034).

ANALYSIS FOR: cover_attempts.pdf
==================================================

**Cover Attempts**

The analysis revealed no significant main effect of Information on cover attempts (F(1, 76) = 3.41, p = 0.069, ηp² = 0.04). The type of task had no significant main effect on cover attempts (F(1, 76) = 0.17, p = 0.683, ηp² = 0.00).

However, there was a significant interaction between Information and Task (F(1, 76) = 4.21, p = 0.044, ηp² = 0.05) (Fig. 1). When information was given, cover attempts were higher for participants in the Book Task group (M = 1.35, SE = 0.24) than those in the No Task group (M = 0.95, SE = 0.24). Conversely, when information was not given, cover attempts were lower for participants in the Book Task group (M = 0.40, SE = 0.24) compared to those in the No Task group (M = 1.00, SE = 0.24).

ANALYSIS FOR: items_observed_across_time.pdf
==================================================

**Items Observed**

Upon analysis Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for the main effect of Time (χ²(2) = 41.49, p < 0.001), and consequently for interactions involving Time. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = 0.706) for the within-subjects effects.

There was a significant main effect of time on the number of items observed (F(1.41, 110.12) = 16.99, p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.179). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction revealed that items observed were significantly lower during the earthquake (M = 0.49, SE = 0.13) compared to before (M = 1.20, SE = 0.21; p < 0.001) and after (M = 1.78, SE = 0.33; p < 0.001). Items observed before the earthquake were also significantly lower than after the earthquake (p = 0.011).

The main effect of Information was not statistically significant (F(1, 78) = 0.15, p = 0.698, ηp² = 0.002).

The interaction between Time and Information was not significant (F(1.41, 110.12) = 1.32, p = 0.266, ηp² = 0.017).

==================================================

Upon analysis Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for the main effect of Time (χ²(2) = 33.66, p < 0.001), and consequently for interactions involving Time. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = 0.734) for the within-subjects effects. There was a significant main effect of time on the number of items picked (F(1.47, 111.63) = 35.83, p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.320). Post hoc comparisons revealed that items picked were significantly lower During the earthquake (M = 2.60, SE = 0.30) compared to Before (M = 4.44, SE = 0.30; p < 0.001) and After (M = 7.05, SE = 0.63; p < 0.001). Items picked Before the earthquake were also significantly lower than After the earthquake (p < 0.001). The main effect of Task was not statistically significant (F(1, 76) = 0.11, p = 0.742, ηp² = 0.001). The main effect of information given was also not significant (F(1, 76) = 1.04, p = 0.312, ηp² = 0.013). No significant interaction was found between Time and Task (F(1.47, 111.63) = 3.33, p = 0.054, ηp² = 0.042). The interaction between Time and Information was not significant (F(1.47, 111.63) = 0.50, p = 0.552, ηp² = 0.007). The interaction between Task and Information was not significant (F(1, 76) = 0.08, p = 0.782, ηp² = 0.001). Finally, the three-way interaction between Time, Task, and Information was not significant (F(1.47, 111.63) = 0.57, p = 0.514, ηp² = 0.007).

ANALYSIS FOR: sitting_transitions.pdf
==================================================

A univariate analysis of variance was conducted for Sitting Transitions. The result revealed that the main effect of Information was not statistically significant (F(1, 76) = 2.415, p = 0.124, ηp² = 0.031). The main effect of Task was also not statistically significant (F(1, 76) = 2.068, p = 0.155, ηp² = 0.026). However, there was a significant interaction between Information and Task (F(1, 76) = 4.261, p = 0.042, ηp² = 0.053). The pattern of means suggests that the effect of information on sitting transitions differed depending on the task condition. For participants in the Book Task condition, Sitting Transitions were higher when Information was Given (M = 10.55, SE = 2.16) compared to when it was Not Given (M = 2.75, SE = 2.16). In contrast, for participants in the No Task condition, Sitting Transitions were similar when Information was Given (M = 9.20, SE = 2.16) and when it was Not Given (M = 10.30, SE = 2.16).

Here are the findings from the ANOVA analysis regarding Time Near Wall:

Upon analysis Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for the main effect of Time (χ²(2) = 8.982, p = 0.011), and consequently for interactions involving Time. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = 0.899) for the within-subjects effects. There was a significant main effect of time on Time Near Wall (F(1.80, 136.58) = 7.99, p = 0.001, ηp² = 0.095). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction revealed that Time Near Wall was significantly lower Before the earthquake (M = 4.16, SE = 0.90) compared to During (M = 10.71, SE = 1.71; p < 0.001) and After (M = 10.94, SE = 2.04; p = 0.007). The difference between During and After was not significant (p = 1.000). A significant main effect was found for Task (F(1, 76) = 5.64, p = 0.020, ηp² = 0.069), with participants in the No Task condition (M = 11.40, SE = 1.67) showing higher overall Time Near Wall than those in the Book Task condition (M = 5.80, SE = 1.67). There was also a significant main effect for Information (F(1, 76) = 4.61, p = 0.035, ηp² = 0.057), with participants given Information (M = 11.13, SE = 1.67) having a higher overall Time Near Wall than those not given Information (M = 6.07, SE = 1.67). There was no significant interaction between Time and Task (F(1.80, 136.58) = 1.29, p = 0.276, ηp² = 0.017). There was a significant interaction between Time and Information (F(1.80, 136.58) = 3.62, p = 0.034, ηp² = 0.046). Before the earthquake, Time Near Wall was similarly low for both the Given (M = 3.97, SE = 1.27) and Not Given (M = 4.34, SE = 1.27) information groups. During the earthquake, Time Near Wall increased substantially more for the Given group (M = 15.69, SE = 2.41) compared to the Not Given group (M = 5.73, SE = 2.41). After the earthquake, Time Near Wall decreased slightly for the Given group (M = 13.74, SE = 2.89) but increased for the Not Given group (M = 8.13, SE = 2.89), although it remained lower than the Given group during the earthquake. The interaction between Task and Information was not significant (F(1, 76) = 2.65, p = 0.107, ηp² = 0.034). Finally, the three-way interaction between Time, Task, and Information was not significant (F(1.80, 136.58) = 2.63, p = 0.082, ηp² = 0.033).

Total Time Spent Sitting

Upon analysis Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for the main effect of Time (χ²(2) = 15.83, p = 0.000), and consequently for interactions involving Time. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = 0.840) for the within-subjects effects.

There was a significant main effect of time on total seated duration (F(1.68, 127.71) = 28.93, p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.276).
